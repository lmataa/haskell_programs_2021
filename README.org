* Haskell from first

Here are my notes on the Haskell language. I intend to keep this up to date as I learn Haskell.
I am not a Haskell programmer, but I am a programmer.

** Haskell REPL

- The REPL is a command line interface to the Haskell language.
- It is a way to interact with the Haskell language.
- It is a way to test out code.

It can be opened in the terminal by typing: `ghci`
If we are working with a file, we can use the `:l` (acronym for :load) command to load the file.
So, for example, if we have a file called `hello.hs`: `ghci hello.hs` will load the file.
And if we are already in the REPL, we can use the `:l hello.hs` command to load the file.


In order to leave the REPL we type `:q` (acronym for :quit).

** Haskell with types
